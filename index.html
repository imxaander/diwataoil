                <h1>Diwata Oil</h1>
                <p> Diwata Oil's essential oil has great advantages and qualities that were exclusively created by our manufacturer. 
                    Unlike other companies selling the same thing, Diwata Oil offers a variety of scent options, allowing clients to sample 
                    our distinctive oils like oregano, lemon, orange, sampaguita (white jasmine), and gumamela (hibiscus). 
                    While Diwata Oil is a natural product made from a single plant species, our essential oil contains strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial characteristics, 
                    as well as an incredible aroma that will undoubtedly make you feel calm and healed throughout the day.
